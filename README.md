### MongoDB example
If you want to use the example for MongoDB you'll need to setup a MongoDB Atlas account and run the installation on your own. This is described in the Medium Article.

### Installation and Setup
Get up and running with the following commands. Cypress is a JavaScript project so youâ€™ll need [node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed, first.
1. Go to a new project directory and run the following:
```bash
npm install cypress
```
2. Now, run the following command to initialize your new Cypress project:
```bash
npx cypress open
```
3. Briefly click through the screens and explore the contents of the new /cypress directory in your project folder.
